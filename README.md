# Halo semua! 

I am an active student at Gunadarma University, Depok. I have been interested in Web Development and also Artificial Intelligence since Covid-19 pandemic. I love exploring Web Development and Artificial Intelligence and how they relate. I am a hard worker, responsible for the tasks given, and like solving problems. I have a dream to create Artificial Intelligence that helps simplify the activities of developers.
